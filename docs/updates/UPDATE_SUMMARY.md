# 📋 Documentation Update Summary

**Completed January 25, 2026**

---

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. Reorganized README.md

**From**: 1,200+ line monolith covering everything  
**To**: 300 line focused entry point

**New Structure**:
- ⚡ TL;DR table (pick your path: Colab / Local / GCP)
- 🎯 What the framework does (4 bullet points)
- 📁 Quick navigation to other docs
- 🚀 Choose your path + quick code example
- 🧬 Multi-testbed overview (not detailed)
- 📊 Data lake explanation
- ✅ First-time checklist

**Benefit**: New users get oriented in 5 minutes, not 20

---

### 2. Created TESTBEDS.md (Testbed Hub)

**Purpose**: Central registry for all testbeds + roadmap

**Contains**:
- 📊 Testbed overview matrix (4 testbeds at a glance)
- 📊 Paper2 detailed section (status, results, quick start)
- 🔄 Paper12 status section (in progress, ETA)
- 📋 Paper5 & Paper7 placeholders (coming soon)
- 🔍 Testbed comparison tables (physics, execution, algorithms)
- 📈 Integration timeline (what's coming when)
- 🎓 Learning path (how to choose your testbed)
- 🤝 Contributing guide (how to add new testbeds)

**Benefit**: 
- Team leads can see status at a glance
- Users can understand all available testbeds
- Roadmap is clear
- Adding new testbeds follows a pattern

---

### 3. Rewrote Paper2_Integration_Report.md

**From**: Scattered in README  
**To**: Dedicated, comprehensive testbed document

**New Structure**:
- 📖 Quick navigation (jump to sections)
- 📖 Overview (what is Paper2, why use it)
- 🌐 Network architecture (diagram, capacities)
- ⚛️ Physics model (equations, per-hop fidelity)
- 🎯 Attack scenarios (5 threat levels, detailed mechanics)
- 🔬 Research questions (RQ1-RQ3 with code examples)
- 🧠 Algorithms (which work best)
- 🚀 Running experiments (copy-paste code examples)
- 📊 Expected results (tables, benchmarks)
- 🧪 8-test validation suite (what each test does)
- 🔍 Troubleshooting (common issues)

**Benefit**: Complete reference for Paper2; never need to search elsewhere

---

### 4. Created Paper2_Quick_Reference.md (Reference Card)

**Purpose**: Quick parameter lookup during experiments

**Contains**:
- 📊 Network parameters table
- ⚛️ Physics parameters (fidelity values)
- 🎯 Experiment settings (horizons, ensemble sizes)
- 🎯 Attack scenarios (rates, parameters)
- 🔬 RQ-specific configurations (lookup table)
- 🧪 Validation checklist
- 📈 Expected performance benchmarks

**Benefit**: Bookmark this. Reference while coding. No searching needed.

---

### 5. Created Supporting Docs (Placeholder Structure)

**Also created**:
- `Paper2_Test_Commands.md` — 8-test validation suite details
- `ORGANIZATION_GUIDE.md` — This structure & rationale

**Ready for future**:
- `Paper12_Integration_Report.md` — Will mirror Paper2 structure
- `Paper12_Quick_Reference.md` — When Paper12 ready
- `Paper12_Test_Commands.md` — When Paper12 ready
- `Paper5_Integration_Report.md` — When Paper5 starts (March)
- `Paper7_Integration_Report.md` — When Paper7 starts (April)

---

## 📊 Information Architecture

### 3-Layer System

```
Layer 1: Entry Point (README.md)
  ↓
  ├─→ Need to set up? → Layer 2a: Setup guides (setup_files/)
  ├─→ Want overview? → Layer 2b: Testbed hub (TESTBEDS.md)
  └─→ Want to run Paper2? → Layer 3: Paper2 reports (docs/)
       ├─ Paper2_Integration_Report.md (deep dive)
       ├─ Paper2_Quick_Reference.md (parameter lookup)
       └─ Paper2_Test_Commands.md (validation tests)
```

### Key Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|---|
| **One entry point** | README.md is navigation hub |
| **Strategic vs tactical** | TESTBEDS.md is strategy (what exists), setup files are tactics (how to do) |
| **Testbed-specific deep dives** | Each integration report covers ONE testbed completely |
| **Modular additions** | Adding Paper5: just add Paper5_Integration_Report.md + update TESTBEDS.md |
| **Quick reference** | Quick ref cards for common parameters & lookups |
| **Clear navigation** | Every doc links to other relevant docs |
