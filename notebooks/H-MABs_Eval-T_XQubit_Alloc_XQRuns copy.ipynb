    "## Research Framework Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive evaluation framework provides rigorous analysis of neural bandit algorithms with clear categorical distinction between different operational environments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Baseline Environment**: Optimal performance benchmark (Oracle)\n",
    "- **Stochastic Environment**: Natural random failures and network noise\n",
    "- **Adversarial Environment**: Strategic intelligent attacks and malicious targeting\n",
    "\n",
    "## Primary Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Algorithm Robustness**: How do neural bandit algorithms perform across different threat models?\n",
    "2. **Comparative Analysis**: Which algorithms demonstrate superior performance in specific scenarios?\n",
    "3. **Quantified Performance**: What are the exact degradation metrics under adversarial conditions?\n",
    "4. **Theoretical Validation**: Do experimental results align with established regret bounds?\n",

    "- **Systematic Environment Categorization**: Clear baseline/stochastic/adversarial taxonomy\n",
    "- **Multi-Algorithm Comparative Testing**: Comprehensive evaluation across 6+ algorithms\n",
    "- **Quantified Robustness Metrics**: Precise performance degradation measurements\n",
    "- **Publication-Ready Analysis**: Academic-quality visualizations and statistical validation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework implements standardized testing protocols across three distinct categories:\n",
    "- **Baseline**: Oracle performance establishing theoretical upper bounds\n",
    "- **Stochastic**: Random environmental perturbations modeling realistic conditions  \n",
    "- **Adversarial**: Strategic attack scenarios simulating malicious interference\n",

    "### Systematic Environment Taxonomy\n",
    "\n",

    "| Environment | Implementation | Threat Characteristic | Research Application |\n",
    "|-------------|----------------|----------------------|---------------------|\n",
    "| **Baseline** | `none` | Deterministic optimal performance | Theoretical upper bound |\n",

    "\n",
    "This framework addresses a critical gap in existing literature where random network failures were often conflated with intentional adversarial attacks. The systematic categorization enables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Precise Robustness Quantification**: Exact performance degradation measurements across threat categories\n",
    "- **Comparative Algorithm Analysis**: Direct performance comparison under identical threat conditions\n",
    "- **Theoretical Validation**: Empirical verification of regret bounds across different adversarial models\n",

    "### Methodological Significance\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous research often lacked clear distinction between stochastic and adversarial environments, limiting the ability to assess true algorithm robustness under intentional attacks versus natural network degradation. This framework provides the necessary precision for rigorous academic evaluation of quantum routing algorithms."

    "\n",
    "**Stochastic Environment**\n",

    "EXPNeuralUCB will demonstrate measurably superior performance retention in adversarial environments relative to baseline neural bandit algorithms lacking specialized adversarial robustness mechanisms.\n",

    "Algorithm performance rankings will exhibit stability across varying adversarial attack intensities, indicating consistent robustness characteristics rather than scenario-dependent performance fluctuations.\n",

    "### Research Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The comparative analysis employs identical experimental conditions across both environments, enabling precise quantification of performance degradation attributable to adversarial targeting while controlling for environmental variables and maintaining statistical rigor in the evaluation process."

    "- **Adaptive Clustering**: Dynamic network partitioning into clusters (blobs) based on entanglement generation success\n",
    "- **Merge/Split Protocol**: Clusters merge when success rate drops below threshold, split when exceeds threshold\n",
    "- **Fusion Management**: Handles n-way quantum state fusion within clusters with noise modeling\n",
    "- **Waxman Topology**: Realistic topological model with spatial characteristics\n",
    "- **Adaptive Thresholding**: Merge/split thresholds scale dynamically with cluster size\n",
