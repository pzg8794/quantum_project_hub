    "## Research Framework Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive evaluation framework provides rigorous analysis of neural bandit algorithms with clear categorical distinction between different operational environments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Baseline Environment**: Optimal performance benchmark (Oracle)\n",
    "- **Stochastic Environment**: Natural random failures and network noise\n",
    "- **Adversarial Environment**: Strategic intelligent attacks and malicious targeting\n",
    "\n",
    "## Primary Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Algorithm Robustness**: How do neural bandit algorithms perform across different threat models?\n",
    "2. **Comparative Analysis**: Which algorithms demonstrate superior performance in specific scenarios?\n",
    "3. **Quantified Performance**: What are the exact degradation metrics under adversarial conditions?\n",
    "4. **Theoretical Validation**: Do experimental results align with established regret bounds?\n",

This framework provides the necessary precision for rigorous academic evaluation of quantum routing algorithms."

    "\n",
    "The comparative analysis employs identical experimental conditions across both environments, enabling precise quantification of performance degradation attributable to adversarial targeting while controlling for environmental variables and maintaining statistical rigor in the evaluation process."

    "\n",
    "**Comprehensive Threat Model Coverage**\n",
    "The evaluation framework addresses the complete spectrum of operational conditions, from optimal deterministic environments through increasingly sophisticated adversarial scenarios, providing unprecedented coverage of realistic deployment conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Graduated Adversarial Complexity Analysis**  \n",
    "The systematic progression from oblivious to sophisticated adversarial models enables precise quantification of algorithm performance degradation as threat sophistication increases, revealing critical robustness thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cross-Environment Validation Protocol**\n",
    "Consistent algorithm ranking across multiple environments validates robustness claims and identifies algorithms with stable performance characteristics independent of operational conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Empirical Robustness Quantification**\n",
    "The multi-environment approach enables precise measurement of performance degradation rates, establishing quantitative robustness metrics that support theoretical predictions and practical deployment decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodological Significance\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive evaluation protocol addresses limitations in existing literature where algorithm assessment often focuses on narrow operational scenarios, providing the empirical foundation necessary for robust algorithm deployment in practical quantum network environments."
