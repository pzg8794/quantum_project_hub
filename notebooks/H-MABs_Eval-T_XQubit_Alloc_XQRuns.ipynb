    "## Research Framework Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive evaluation framework provides rigorous analysis of neural bandit algorithms with clear categorical distinction between different operational environments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Baseline Environment**: Optimal performance benchmark (Oracle)\n",
    "- **Stochastic Environment**: Natural random failures and network noise\n",
    "- **Adversarial Environment**: Strategic intelligent attacks and malicious targeting\n",
    "\n",
    "## Primary Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Algorithm Robustness**: How do neural bandit algorithms perform across different threat models?\n",
    "2. **Comparative Analysis**: Which algorithms demonstrate superior performance in specific scenarios?\n",
    "3. **Quantified Performance**: What are the exact degradation metrics under adversarial conditions?\n",
    "4. **Theoretical Validation**: Do experimental results align with established regret bounds?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Research Contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Systematic Environment Categorization**: Clear baseline/stochastic/adversarial taxonomy\n",
    "- **Multi-Algorithm Comparative Testing**: Comprehensive evaluation across 6+ algorithms\n",
    "- **Quantified Robustness Metrics**: Precise performance degradation measurements\n",
    "- **Publication-Ready Analysis**: Academic-quality visualizations and statistical validation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework implements standardized testing protocols across three distinct categories:\n",
    "- **Baseline**: Oracle performance establishing theoretical upper bounds\n",
    "- **Stochastic**: Random environmental perturbations modeling realistic conditions  \n",
    "- **Adversarial**: Strategic attack scenarios simulating malicious interference\n",
    "\n",
    "Each algorithm undergoes identical testing conditions enabling direct performance comparison and robustness quantification across all operational environments."

    "### Systematic Environment Taxonomy\n",
    "\n",
    "This research framework establishes precise categorical distinctions for quantum network evaluation environments, addressing previous ambiguity in threat model classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environmental Categories\n",
    "\n",
    "| Environment | Implementation | Threat Characteristic | Research Application |\n",
    "|-------------|----------------|----------------------|---------------------|\n",
    "| **Baseline** | `none` | Deterministic optimal performance | Theoretical upper bound |\n",
    "| **Stochastic** | `stochastic`/`random` | Natural random failures | Realistic network conditions |\n",
    "| **Adversarial** | `markov` | Oblivious strategic attacks | Pattern-based targeting |\n",

    "### Research Contribution\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework addresses a critical gap in existing literature where random network failures were often conflated with intentional adversarial attacks. The systematic categorization enables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Precise Robustness Quantification**: Exact performance degradation measurements across threat categories\n",
    "- **Comparative Algorithm Analysis**: Direct performance comparison under identical threat conditions\n",
    "- **Theoretical Validation**: Empirical verification of regret bounds across different adversarial models\n",
    "- **Reproducible Research Standards**: Standardized evaluation protocols for quantum network algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodological Significance\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous research often lacked clear distinction between stochastic and adversarial environments, limiting the ability to assess true algorithm robustness under intentional attacks versus natural network degradation. This framework provides the necessary precision for rigorous academic evaluation of quantum routing algorithms."

    "EXPNeuralUCB will demonstrate measurably superior performance retention in adversarial environments relative to baseline neural bandit algorithms lacking specialized adversarial robustness mechanisms.\n",

    "Algorithm performance rankings will exhibit stability across varying adversarial attack intensities, indicating consistent robustness characteristics rather than scenario-dependent performance fluctuations.\n",

    "### Research Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The comparative analysis employs identical experimental conditions across both environments, enabling precise quantification of performance degradation attributable to adversarial targeting while controlling for environmental variables and maintaining statistical rigor in the evaluation process."
