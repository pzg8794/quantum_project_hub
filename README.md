# GA-Work Repository

This repository contains research projects, testbeds, and documentation for quantum computing and network routing research.

## Main Research Framework

The primary research framework is the **Quantum Multi-Armed Bandit Research Framework** for adversarial quantum entanglement routing. See the detailed documentation in [hybrid_variable_framework/README.md](hybrid_variable_framework/README.md).

## Documentation

All documentation is organized in the [docs/](docs/) directory. See [docs/INDEX.md](docs/INDEX.md) for a complete index of available documentation.

## Projects

- [hybrid_variable_framework/](hybrid_variable_framework/) - **Main Framework**: Quantum Multi-Armed Bandit Research Framework for adversarial quantum routing
- [clustered-quantum-routing/](clustered-quantum-routing/) - Clustered quantum routing implementation
- [Testbeds/](Testbeds/) - Collection of quantum network testbeds
- [quantum_project_hub/](quantum_project_hub/) - Quantum project hub (documentation moved to docs/)
- [GA Papers/](GA Papers/) - Research papers and development
- [GraduateAssistantCV/](GraduateAssistantCV/) - CV and resume materials

## Getting Started

See the [Quick Start Guide](docs/guides/QUICK_START_GUIDE.md) for setup instructions, or the framework's [TL;DR guide](hybrid_variable_framework/README.md#⚡-tldr--get-started-in-5-minutes) for immediate setup.
